# Git Game: *Commit or Revert*

## What This Is
This is a short, low-stakes game designed to help you learn how GitHub works **by playing**, not by memorizing commands.

You will take turns either:
- **Adding to a shared story**, or
- **Reverting the story to an earlier version**

Nothing you do can permanently break the project.

---

## The Goal
There is no single “winner.”

The goals are to:
- Practice making commits
- See how project history works
- Learn how and when reverts are useful
- Get comfortable making (and undoing) changes

---

## The Files
You will work with **one file only**:

```
game_doc.md
```

This file contains an unfinished story with section headings.

---

## Rules of the Game

### On Your Turn, Choose ONE Action

### Option A: Make a Commit
- Add **1–2 sentences** to **one section** of the story
- Do not edit multiple sections
- Save your changes

**Commit message format:**
```
ADD: <brief description of what you added>
```

Examples:
- `ADD: Introduce a new character in Setting`
- `ADD: Clarify the Turning Point`

---

### Option B: Revert a Commit
- Open the commit history
- Choose **one earlier commit** to revert
- Confirm the revert

**Commit message format:**
```
REVERT: <brief reason for the revert>
```

Examples:
- `REVERT: Remove contradictory event`
- `REVERT: Undo confusing subplot`

Reverting is allowed and expected. It is not rude.

---

## Important Rules
- You must **commit every change**
- You may not undo your own move immediately
- You may not edit commit history
- Keep content appropriate for class

---

## Helpful Tips
- Small changes are safer than big ones
- Clear commit messages help future players
- If something feels broken, reverting is often the best move
- Nothing is ever truly lost — Git remembers everything

---

## What to Do If You’re Unsure
If you’re unsure whether to commit or revert:
- Ask yourself: *Does this improve clarity or coherence?*
- Either choice is valid

---

## After the Game
We will briefly discuss:
- Which commits lasted
- Which were reverted
- How commit messages affected decisions
- What this teaches us about using GitHub for real projects

---

## One Last Thing
This game is not about writing ability.  
It is about learning how **history, commits, and reverts** work.

Be bold. Make moves. The timeline can always be repaired.
