# Day 1

## Overview of class structure

 - Go over syllabus
 - Goals of class
 - Class time usage

## Git and GitHub

 - Ensure students have made a GitHub account

Git/GitHub is an industry standard for "version control", i.e. a way to track changes and to quickly and easily revert them or incorporate them into a working project. Think GoogleDrive but more robust (and hence, unfortunately, more complicated).

**You cannot break GitHub beyond repair** otherwise nobody would use it!

- Show:
  - A repo = folder with memory
  - Commits = save points
  - History = rewind button
- Demo:
  - Make AboutMe.md file together
  - Edit a file directly on GitHub
  - Make a commit
  - Undo a commit by reverting
  
Git hub is a time machine for your work. If you’ve ever written a file called final_FINAL_v3.pdf, GitHub exists for you.

GitHub is not just for programmers, it's for ANY collaborative writing.



## Activity: Write a story

In `/Commit_or_Revert_Stories` you'll find instructions for an activity where groups of students will take turns adding to a story.

To begin, you need to *Fork* the repository. This creates a copy of it where *you* are the owner, and hence can edit and change anything you want.

Then, in your group, choose which story to work on, and have fun!
